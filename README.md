## FLASK REST & SOAP & GRAPHQL API 

### Goal of the exercise: 

Have one in memory object that can be manipulated with the three different protocols:

- REST
- SOAP
- GRAPHQL

So the api should be able to:

1. Create a pet object through a REST POST request
2. Read a pet object through a REST GET request
3. Update a pet object though SOAP POST request
4. Delete a pet object through GRAPHQL POST request


### Features

- Flask 
- Flask-RESTful to build quick REST APIs
- SQLAlchemy in-memory database
- Spyne RPC Toolkit to process and execute SOAP requests
- Graphene for building GraphQL schemas/types fast and easily
- Gunicorn for a Python WSGI HTTP Server
- Docker to run Gunicorn and make development easier overall
- Postman to make sure test endpoints
- A variety of more toolkits to help tie all these together and handle errors
